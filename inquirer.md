# Inquirer

If you get to trying to make your Pokemon game an actual game, youâ€™ll want to have a look at how inquirer works

- The most recent version of this npm package makes use of ECMAScript Modules which you are free to look into [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules) rather than _Common JS Modules_ which is the method we've been using so far of providing data between JS files via `module.exports` and `require`
- In order to use `inquirer` in your project using Common JS Modules:

## Install version 8! `npm install inquirer@^8.0.0`

- Some of the examples in this folder on their github will help https://github.com/SBoudrias/Inquirer.js/tree/master/packages/inquirer/examples

This uses something called Promises in javascript, which we will cover in more detail at the end of next week, but for now, the general idea is along the lines of the following:

```js
const inquirer = require('inquirer');

const firstQuestions = [
  {
    type: 'input',
    name: 'name',
    message: 'What is your name?',
    default: 'Ash',
  },
  {
    type: 'list',
    name: 'pokemon',
    message: 'Which pokemon do you choose?',
    choices: ['Pikachu', 'Magikarp'],
  },
  // etc...
];

const secondQuestions = [
  //... see examples to how to format questions
];

function playGame() {
  inquirer
    .prompt(firstQuestions)
    .then(function (firstAnswers) {
      // do stuff with the answers to the firstQuestions, e.g. create trainers and catch pokemon
      console.log(firstAnswers);
      return inquirer.prompt(secondQuestions);
    })
    .then(function (secondAnswers) {
      // do stuff with the answers to the secondQuestions, e.g. choose moves to use / fight / run away / select pokemon to fight with
    });
}

playGame();
```
